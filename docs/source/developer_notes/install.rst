Installation
------------

The command line applications are installable as a collective set via the
pip (or pipx) package manager:

.. code-block::

   pipx install git+https://github.com/pitt-crc/wrappers.git

The ``pipx`` utility is recommended for system administrators working in a
multi-tenancy environment.
