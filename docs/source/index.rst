CRC Wrapper Applications
========================

Command line applications for wrapping common HPC tasks.

The CRC wrapper applications provide a simplified interface for running common
HPC tasks on Slurm based clusters. They are designed as a stepping stone for
users who are new to working on HPC systems and still unfamiliar with the complex
functionality provided by Slurm.

A Note to External HPC Teams
----------------------------

These applications were built by and for the University of Pittsburgh
Center for Research Computing (CRC). Most applications documented here will work
out of the box on a generic Slurm cluster systems. However, some applications
are built specifically for the CRC and depend on internal CRC systems.
